Rosamonte,"In 1936, Mr. Demetrio HREÑUK, son of Ukrainian immigrants, with the active participation of his wife Catalina, founded a family business dedicated in the early years to the planting, harvesting and drying of yerba mate. In 1966 he acquires his first mill and starts the commercialization of the processed yerba mate. Thus Yerba Mate ROSAMONTE was born. Over the years, HREÑUK S.A. was established on the same trunk, which expanded its production, processing and marketing activities to other areas of economic activity, adding Tea, Aquaculture, Livestock, Forestry and Cold Storage. Based on these concepts: honesty, optimum quality, consumer needs and market demands, we promoted and settled our development and growth in Apóstoles, province of Misiones. Working with honesty and committed to the quality of our products, in HREÑUK S.A. we have always devoted all our efforts to satisfy the needs of the consumer, continuously adapting to the changing demands of a market, both national and international, more and more demanding.

Playadito,"Since the end of the 19th century, successive contingents of immigrants arrived in Argentina in search of the peace and work they could not find in their countries of origin. Among them, a large group of Germans, including agricultural producers, settled in the northeast of the Province of Corrientes. From there, they integrated the Ukrainian and Polish immigrants who were already established in the south of the Province of Misiones, in the city of Ap��stoles. Together with their capacity for work and sacrifice, this human group brought the model of Cooperative Societies as a form of organization of solidarity economy. This is how the Agricultural Cooperative of Colonia Liebig Ltda. was founded, which today in its 95th anniversary, integrated by 126 associated producers, has fulfilled the dream of those immigrants. The direction of its first days was headed by its first President Walter Orstermann, being currently presided by Ricardo Daniel Handziak, Yerba Mate, the product that identifies it, with its brand layadito, leads the Argentine market, and is present in 12 countries in all continents, with an annual production of 36 million kilos of processed product.
